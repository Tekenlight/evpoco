Requirements:

Provides a dynamic memory stream for reading data coming in from a socket.

Assumptions:

Length of the incoming data is not known


Implementation

The need is met through a list of buffers of length 4096 bytes each
While receiving data from socket, a function is called on the class to provide a new 
	buffer and data is read into that buffer.

A method is provided for reading data from the buffer, which retrieves <= requested_length
	of data from the buffer, if the buffer is run out, a EOF is returned.
