Benchmark done between C++ and LUA servers, both implementiing the formserver post functionality.
The test setup is the server has 4 threads which process the POST request in an event driven manner
There is a load generator which runs 4 processes, each process handles 10000 request-responses
The test starts with the measuring the start time before load generator is run
Test completes with measuring time after all 4 processes have handled 10000 requests each

Net time is end time minus start time

Idea is to compare how much time is taken to process the 40000 request-response on a 4 core machine
Memory is not a bottleneck.

Results are as follows

 ----------------------------------
|SERVER          |  C++   |   LUA  |
|----------------------------------|
|TOTAL TIME      |  180s  |   202s |
|----------------------------------|
|RESPONSE TIME   |  18ms  |   20ms |
|PER REQUEST     |        |        |
 ---------------------------------- 


We can conculde from theis that LUA server is taking an additional 2ms of CPU time per request
It is evident that LUA server will take more time, the aim of this experiment is to find out
how much is the degradation due to usage of an interpreted language.

The conclusion is that it is not much in the case of serving HTTP requests and LUA can be used
as the language for expressing business logic.

Care can be taken to express all common functionality and algorithns using C/C++ and use them as
hooks from within LUA than to have all the processing done in LUA iteself.
